/* Example 20: Workers working in a factory with a fixed salary receive additional salaries depending on their family situation. If the number of children is 1, they receive 5% of their
 salary, if they have 2 children, 10%, and if they have 3 or more children, they receive 15% of their salary. Accordingly, the algorithm performs the necessary calculation by asking the user for the worker's salary and the number of children. */
