/* Example 21:  The following criteria are followed when calculating the wage of a worker in a factory
 If the worker has worked less than 40 hours, the wage he will receive is calculated by multiplying
  the hours worked and the hourly wage. If the worker has worked 40 hours or more, the hours worked will be calculated
   as 2 hour, and the algorithm prints the amount tobe paid by taking the information accordingly. */
